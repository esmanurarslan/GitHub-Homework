Hello ,
I am Esma, and I am typing 'hellooo git'
See u

I have to make some changes for new branch activity.

The text above was created while doing the tasks.
This section of the text to explain  my homework.

I created a new repository. And some terminal commands was executed for tasks.
These are sequentially:
  *cd Desktop
  *git clone  https://github.com/esmanurarslan/GitHub-Homework
  
  *cd GitHub-Homework
  *touch homework.txt
  
  *git add homework.txt
  *git commit -m "Add homework.txt file"
  *git push origin main
  
  *git branch feature-branch
  *git checkout feature-branch
  
  *nano homework.txt
  *git add homework.txt
  *git commit -m "Make changes to homework.txt in feature-branch"
  *git push origin feature-branch
  
  *git checkout main
  *git merge feature-branch
  *git push origin main

For another tasks, i used github web page. 
I invited Eslem for collabrate with me. And she is one of the writer of my project.
I created an issue that is funny issue.And i moved these issue to the my project's 'to do' section.
